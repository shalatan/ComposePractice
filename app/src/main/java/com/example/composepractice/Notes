- remember
    : helps retain state across recompositions, but not configuration changes
- rememberSaveable
    : automatically saves any value that can be saved in Bundle
    : use to restore UI state after an Activity or process is recreated

    : Stateful Composable is a composable that owns a piece of state that can change over time
    : Stateless Composable is a composable that doesn't owns any state.
- State Hoisting
    : Pattern of moving state to a composable's caller to make a composable Stateless
